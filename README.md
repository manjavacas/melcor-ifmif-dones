## üìù About

This project includes the [MELCOR 1.8.6 model](https://energy.sandia.gov/programs/nuclear-energy/nuclear-energy-safety-security/melcor/) of the [IFMIF-DONES](https://ifmif-dones.es/) main building (**under development**).

## ‚öõÔ∏è IFMIF-DONES

The *International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility ‚Äì Demo Oriented NEutron Source* (**IFMIF-DONES**) is a single-sited novel research infrastructure for testing, validation and qualification of the materials to be used in future fusion power plants like [DEMO](https://www.euro-fusion.org/programme/demo/) (a demonstration fusion reactor prototype). In relation to this international project, in December 2017, [Fusion for Energy](https://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/) (F4E) evaluated positively the joint Spain - Croatia proposal to site the IFMIF-DONES in **Granada** (Spain).

## üñ•Ô∏è MELCOR

**MELCOR** (portmanteu from ‚Äúmelting core‚Äù) is a fully integrated, engineering-level computer code developed by [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) for the¬†U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission¬†to model the progression of severe accidents in nuclear power plants. A broad spectrum of severe accident phenomena in both boiling and pressurized water reactors is treated in MELCOR in a unified framework. Furthermore, its generalized framework and ability to track aerosol/vapor species makes it  applicable for non-nuclear safety related applications. MELCOR applications include estimation of severe accident source terms, and their sensitivities and uncertainties in a variety of applications.
